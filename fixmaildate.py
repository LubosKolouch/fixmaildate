I migrated from GMail to Mac OS X Server mail and the dates for
mails were all wrong in Mail.app (or, as the kids say, 'Apple
Mail'). I finally got tired of it and after a little research found
that this is determined by the mtime of the files in dovecot's
maildir, or mdir, or whatever it's called.

I wasn't the only one:
http://www.dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2008-July/032152.html

So I wrote this script.

It parses each file in a mail directory and then sets the mtime to
that date. I had 45000 mails and it worked pretty well, but I suggest
you stop your mail server while doing this. It recursively enters
directories so you can point it at a specific folder, user, or the
mail directory for all users.

After starting the server and reconnecting Mail.app, select each
folder and go to Mailbox -> Rebuild. It will download each message
again, so make sure you're on a fast connection to your server. Or
you could just recreate your account. Maybe there's a better way.
